This study examines the potential relationship between trust in various sectors of society, including but not limited to government, scientific institutions, the media, and others. The primary questions guiding this research are whether individuals who exhibit distrust in certain areas maintain consistent trust in opposing sectors. For example, do individuals who lack trust in scientific institutions tend to place trust in traditional healing practices, or do those who trust the government simultaneously express distrust toward their neighbors?
