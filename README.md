## Overview
This study examines the potential relationship between trust in various sectors of society, including but not limited to government, scientific institutions, the media, and others. The primary questions guiding this research are whether individuals who exhibit distrust in certain areas maintain consistent trust in opposing sectors. For example, do individuals who lack trust in scientific institutions tend to place trust in traditional healing practices, or do those who trust the government simultaneously express distrust toward their neighbors?

## How to use
While the `database_creation.ipynb` file is a good first step if you're interested in seeing how the different static visuals were made by each of us, the interactive visualization works entirely without needing it as it utilized a fully cleaned and merged csv file to ease user engagement.

## Ethical Considerations
While most of our data including location, city, and population data were all standard information and estimates, we still took the time to make sure that all of our data was obtained ethically, reliably, and respected all aspects of privacy and copyright considerations. The main piece of all our data was the global trust survey, provided by the Wellcome Global Monitor as a module within the Gallup World Poll. 
To quote their survey methodology: “The World Poll has regularly surveyed people in over 160 countries using mixed methods of telephone and face-to-face interviewing, depending on the country. In a typical year, the poll results represent more than 95% of the world’s population aged 15+ by using randomly selected, nationally representative samples.”
